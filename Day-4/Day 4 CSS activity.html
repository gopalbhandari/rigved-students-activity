    <div id="block">
        <p>Ukraine has been hit by more cyber-attacks, which its government says are "on a completely different level".

            Earlier on Wednesday, the websites of several Ukrainian banks and government departments became inaccessible.
            
            Internet connectivity company NetBlocks tweeted: "The incident appears consistent with recent DDOS attacks."
            
            Distributed denial of service attacks are designed to knock a website offline by flooding it with huge amounts of requests until it crashes.</p>
    </div>
    <div id=""block>
        <p>"Another mass DDoS attack on our state [has] begun," Ukraine's Digital Transformation Minister, Mykhaylo Fedorov, wrote on Telegram.

            NetBlocks data indicates the impact began on Wednesday afternoon, intensifying in severity over the course of the day.
            
            A researcher told BBC News: "Ukraine's military and banking websites have seen a more rapid recovery after today's cyber-attack, likely due to preparedness and increased capacity to implement mitigations.
            
            "Despite this, the incident is ongoing, with latency and outages continuing at the Security Service of Ukraine, which points to the severity of the incident."</p>

    <div id="block">
        <p>Last week, a similar attack took a smaller number of websites in the country offline.

            And cyber authorities in the UK and the US swiftly blamed that attack on Russian hackers under direct orders from the Kremlin.
            
            But Moscow denied being involved - and no official blame has been levelled at Russia for the latest attacks.
            
            In January, the Ukrainian government accused Russia of being behind another DDoS wave that affected about 70 government websites, some replaced with a warning to Ukrainians to "prepare for the worst".
            
            Access to most of the sites was restored within hours.</p>
